	Namaste, my name is Priya and I am from Queens, New York -- one of the most diverse places in the country. 
I grew up being exposed to many other cultures, and along the way I learned how to dance salsa from my Dominican neighbors, 
	    how to braid hair from my Malian friend in high school, 
	    and I grew to love Thai food after a bubble tea spot opened up a few blocks away from my apartment. 
	    My exposure to my own South Asian culture and other ethnicities drew me to get my BA in Journalism to become a storyteller. 
	    We are all differnet and it is through understanding one another that we can become more compassionate in this world. 
	       <p class="space">  </p>
      I am currently a reporter covering community driven stories, 
      including local politics, education, and public health in New York City 
      through writing, photography, and videography.
